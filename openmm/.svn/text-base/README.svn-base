OpenMM scripts for relative alchemical free energy calculations involving ring-opening/closing.

MANIFEST

benzene-example.py - a simple benzene example that breaks one bond
analyze.py - analyze results of Hamiltonian exchange
examples/ - examples directory

repex.py - replica-exchange module
thermodynamics.py - support module for replica-exchange
timeseries.py - timeseries analysis (for autocorrelation times)
pymbar.py - copy of the pyMBAR distribution for MBAR free energy analysis

USAGE

# Run the benzene example (starting from scratch).
# Note that re-running without deleting repex.nc will simply resume from last consistent snapshot.
rm -f repex.nc ; python benzene-example.py

# Analyze the simulation and generate PDB files of replica trajectories.
python analyze.py
